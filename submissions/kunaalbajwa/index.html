Ever thought "Gee I really wanna be able to test my might in the Kumite but gosh I'm terrible"? you might not be cool
enough to learn. Well you are now!
Hello sir and or madam, congrads on finding this site. You can be cool now too with the help of Dux Kan Do,
the self-defense system developed by Patches O' Hoolihand! Yes that Patches O' Hoolihand!
We at Dux Kan Do are the future of martial arts and cover the three basics of all forms of combat: Weapons, Grappling, and Striking.
</p> </article>
<h3>
    Weapons
</h3>
<p>
Weapons just like low bandwith, are an unfortunate part of today's world.
You will are the extensions of ourselves. Garambit, SEGA DreamCasts, cludgeons, frying pans, plastic mallets,
legendary and ancient phone books, plastic knives and even horse hair fiddles. <br>All of these are weapons
we will show you how to use weapons with the precision of a dragon fang and how to disarm with lightning speed and power of a honeybadger.
<br>Arts that we will draw from: Kali, Krav Maga, and MCMap (2016).
</p>

<h3>
    Grappling
</h3>

<p>
Grappling is like water sliding and playing monarch
of the mountain except it's on the floor. But don't mistake this for tomfoolery. It's an essential part to
one's survival. Of course this begins with understanding the connections of another and one's
own body and the physical attributes of said fighter
of using levers, and center of gravity. <br>Arts that we will draw from are, Pencak Silat,
Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, Greco-Roman Pankration and American Wrestling.
</p>

<h3>
    Striking

</h3>
<div class = 'start'>
<p>
Ah the pentultimate fun for any fighter. Think of it as high fiving your best friend.
Except it's sometimes a closed hand and you are "high-fiving" the liver. Learn how to "tag"
your friends with speed, power, and accuracy of a 3D printer. <br>Arts we will draw from are western boxing, Kali, and the Wu-Tang Sword style.

     <p>This is his actual face. And this is the face YOU will make. Of course this comes after years of cultivation and practice and
    not overnight.
    </p>

<br>Also a metric ton of protein helps. As well as being from the 1980s.
Most importantly this attack will unleash your full potential and will be taught for a small extra fee of $100. <br>
    <p>Absolutely no refunds, CASH only.</p>
